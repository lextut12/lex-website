index.html
I don't see a `$PLACEHOLDER$` marker in your HTML code. The file appears to be complete as-is.

If you're looking to add something specific, could you clarify what you'd like to insert? For example:
- Additional CSS styles?
- More interactive features?
- Data export functionality?
- Mobile responsiveness improvements?

Let me know what functionality you need, and I'll help you add it.
